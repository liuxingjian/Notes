China's urbanization will help release potential domestic demand. Some economists pointed out that almost all developing cities in China are facing the process of urbanization, so people's living standards will be improved, and employment opportunities will also increase. As more and more people migrate to cities, housing and urban infrastructure construction, including the supply of water and other energy sources, will become the focus of urban development. In addition, the free and rapid circulation of goods and services is a basic feature of an urbanized society, so gradually expanding cities need more retail stores to meet consumer demand.





Courage is the ability to face difficulties and overcome them. Life is full of suffering. People must go through all kinds of difficulties and challenges to succeed. Courage is that you can continue to face life after experiencing various failures.

Courage is the power to inspire you to continue to stand up after you have suffered a major failure. Winston Churchill once said, "Courage is what it takes to stand up." Courage is not a momentary impulse, nor is it something that others dare not do. 

Courage makes us dare to challenge ourselves. Courage is the ability to do something difficult even when there's risk. Courageous people do and say what they think is right despite opposition. Courage is the ability to control your fear in a dangerous or difficult situation and to be brave and confident enough to do what you believe in. 

If you continue to stand up after being defeated, it is courage.
