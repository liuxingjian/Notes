Task 3 (video 3):

 Write a complaint letter to the manager of the restaurant and explain the problems based on the preceding situation. 
（以书面word文档形式完成，截止完成时间为本周末，到时递交至QQ群）

　I’m writing to lodge the complaint about the poor quality of an air conditioner that I purchased from Sun Appliance Company. Frankly speaking, Sun Appliance has always been my favorite. On April 4, 2007, I bought the air conditioner (serial number 12345) from one of your chain store located in Lang Fang. The machine operated well at first, but ten days later, there was a fault that bothered me, that is, the fan made so much noise that I could not sleep well at night. Worse still, the cooling system didn’t work well and the machine began to leak recently. Its poor quality ruined almost all my previous impression toward your products.
　　I strongly suggest that a repairman or a service engineer should be sent to my home without delay. I wonder if you could pinpoint the exact cause of the malfunction as soon as possible. If you can’t, I am afraid that I will request for full amount of refund or a new air conditioner. I would appreciate all your assistance in this matter. If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to contact me. Look forward to your reply. Yours Sincerely, Li Ming







I'm writing to lodge the complaint about the poor service and food of your restaurant. Frankly speaking, your restaurant has always been one of my favorite. Therefore, on November 11, 2019, I recommended your restaurant to my friends when we decided to dine together. However,  I couldn't understand why out food took so long to prepare but other customers didn't. What's more, what a terrible service, your waiter ignored our request about preparing food quickly. Besides, I suspect your restaurant had used outdated food or the food had not been disinfected because my two friends with me had severe stomach-aches the following day. In addition, we still thought your food  was also overpriced even though your dining environments was better than others.

I hope there is a misunderstand in this but in fact my friends and I are disappointed and  I strongly suggest that you can give us a convincing explanation and apologize for us. Look forward to your reply.

Yours sincerely,

Xiao Ming







Today I am going to introduce a special memorable special that I have tried in a restaurant when I was traveling. The name of this dish is Chop bell pepper fish head a traditional dish of Hunan Province. It is said that the origin was related to Huang Zongxian, a literati in the Qing Dynasty.

It is usually steamed with fish head, chopped peppers, and oil, ginger, spring onion, garlic and other auxiliary [ɔɡ'zɪljəri]  materials. The dishes are bright in color, strong in flavor, and tender in meat. Fat but not greasy, fresh and spicy.All in a word, it is very delicous.
