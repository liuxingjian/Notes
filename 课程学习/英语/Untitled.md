Would you prefer living alone or living with roommates



When it comes to live alone or live with roommates, people's opinions differ. Many people believe that living alone is the best choice. For one thing, you can decorate however you want. When you live alone, you are the god of your apartment and you can  decorate the house according to your preferences. For the other thing, you have total freedom. Many people believe  the biggest benefit about living alone is that you have complete control and total freedom. You can clean your room every day if you want a neat and clean room. However,  no one will be there to tell you what should you do if you have a mess room.

As for as I am concerned, I prefer living with roommates. On one hand, I can enjoy a bigger apartment. I would be able to afford a bigger place with roommates to help me pay the rent. A large bedroom, a second bathroom, and a big kitchen is the must for my ideal house. Roommates can share a lot of costs of renting the house. On the other hand, I would not feel alone with friends around.  I prefer having a long-lasting relationship and a good roommates can easily be a lifelong friend. 

In a word, I prefer living with roommates
